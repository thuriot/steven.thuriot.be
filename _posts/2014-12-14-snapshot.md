When working with a mutable instance, it's often useful to keep a certain state of that object. This issue is usually solved by implementing `IClonable` or using `Serialization` (followed by `Deserialization`).

This might be an issue, however, when that instance is one from a third-party library. I wrote a little library, called [Snapshot](https://github.com/StevenThuriot/Snapshot), that uses the DLR to come up with a solution to this problem.

By default, it will map all public properties and fields to a dynamic object. This behaviour is configurable. 
You will end up with a dynamic object with the same **public** signature as the one you took a snapshot of.


```csharp
var person = new Person("Steven", "Thuriot");
person.Age = 27;

var snapshot = person.TakeSnapshot();

person.Age = 28;

Console.WriteLine("Person age: {0}", person.Age);
Console.WriteLine("Snapshot age: {0}", snapshot.Age);
```

---

Output:

```xml
Person age: 28
Snapshot age: 27
```
